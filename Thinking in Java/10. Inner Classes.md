# Inner Classes

place a class definition within another class definition.

### Creating inner classes

make an object of the inner class anywhere except from within a __non-static__ method of the outer class: specify the type of that object as _OuterClassName.InnerClassName_

Class Outer {
    Class Inner {
        private int i;
        Inner(int value) {
            i = value;
        }
    }
    int main(){
        Outer o = new Outer();
        Outer.Inner i = new Inner(5);
    }
}

### The link to the outer class

when create an inner class: an object of that inner class has a _link to the enclosing object_, and it can access the members of that enclosing object
