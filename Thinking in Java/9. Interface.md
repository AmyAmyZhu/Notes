# Interfaces

### Abstract classes and methods

__abstract__ method: a method that is incomplete; it has only a declaration and no method body

```
abstract void f();
```

__abstract__ class: a class containing abstract methods

if you inherit from an __abstract__ class and you want to make objects of the new type, you must provide method definitions for all the __abstract__ methods in the base class

### Interfaces

__interface__ keyword: produces a completely abstract class, one that provides no implementation at all

### Complete decoupling

Strategy design pattern: create a method that behaves differently depending on the argument object that you pass

### "Multiple inheritance" in Java

### Extending an interface with inheritance
#### Name collisions when combining Interfaces

### Adapting to an interface

### Fields in interfaces
#### Initializing fields in interfaces

### Nesting interfaces

### Interfaces and factories
