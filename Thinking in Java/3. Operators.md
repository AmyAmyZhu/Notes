# Operators

### Simpler print statements

__static import__: allow access to any static member of a class directly. No need to qualify it by class name.
- Good: less code
- Bad: ambiguity
```
import static net.mindview.util.Print.*;
```

### Using Java operators

__side effect__: some operators change the value of an operand

Almost all operators work only with primitives

'=', '==', and '!=' work with all objects

__String__ class supports '+' and '+='

### Assignment

object: copy a reference from one place to another; if c = d for objects, both c and d point to the object that, originally, only d pointed to

aliasing: two variables point to the same object

To avoid aliasings
```
t1.level = t2.level;
```

### Mathematical operators

+, -, *, /, %

__Random__:
```
Randon rand = new Random(47); // 47 is a seed
// Choose value from 1 to 100
i = rand.nextInt(100) + 1;
```

### Auto increment and decrement

preincrement: ++ operator appears before the variable

post-increment: ++ operator appears after the variable

### Relational operators

boolean result: <, >, <=, >=, ==, !=

#### Testing object equivalence

compare two objects by using '==' results __false__ since two objects are not the same reference though they have the same contents

special method __equals()__ compare the actual contents of an object for equivalence; CAUTION: need override the method and re-implement for our classes, the default one not work

### Logical operators

AND(&&), OR(||), NOT(!)

#### Short-circuiting

short-circuiting: expression will be evaluated only until the truth or falsehood of the entire expression can be unambiguously determined

### Literals

#### Exponential notation

```
float expFloat = 1.39e-43f;
// must have f, otherwise compiler takes numbers as doubles

```

### Bitwise operators

bitwise And (&): produces a one in the output bit if both input bits are one

bitwise Or (|): produces a one in the output bit if either input bit is one

bitwise EXCLUSIVE OR (^): produces a one in the output bit if one or the other input bit is a noe, but not both

bitwise NOT (~): unary operator

### Shift operators

left-shift operator (<<): produces the operand to the left of the operator after it has been shifted to the left

right-shift operator (>>): produces the operand to the left of the operator after it has been shifted to the right

for (<<= or >>= or >>>=): __char__, __short__ not shift; __int__, __long__ shift

### Ternary if-else operator

ternary/conditional operator:
```
boolean-exp ? value0 : value1
```
